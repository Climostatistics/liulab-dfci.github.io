desp: Chenfei Wang received PhD in Bioinformatics from Tongji University. He is now a Postdoctoral Fellow of Biostatistics and Computational Biology at Harvard University and Dana-Farber Cancer Institute. During his PhD period he studied the epigenetic reprogramming of mammalian early embryos and somatic nuclear transferred (SCNT) embryos utilizing high throughput genomic data. Now he is interested in investigating the mechanism of cancer and immune interactions based on single-cell RNA-seq and epigenomic-seq, and focus on utilizing machine learning algorithms to decipher the regulation of immune diversity and cancer progression.
